# About Me

As a social entrepreneur, data analyst, and advocate for women's empowerment, I founded Nockafriq Vogue, a creative brand in my community, Wa. The brand has empowered over 50 women artisans in textile production and aligns with SDGs 5, 8, and 9.
  
 I leverage my background in education and data analysis using Power BI, Tableau and Excel to create meaningful impacts in my community, particularly women traders, in improving their businesses. Recognized among Ghana's top 100 women entrepreneurs by Elevate by Ecobank (2023) and Women in Africa (2022).  
  
I am passionate about mentoring youth, promoting community environmental care and gender equality through training initiatives. I am friendly, adventurous, and enjoy dancing in my room during my leisure time. I am eager to explore new opportunities, particularly in the tech industry.
